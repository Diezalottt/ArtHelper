    Drawing History: To enable users to go back to previous versions of their drawings or to save their work to continue later, you would store this data in a database.

    Analytics: If you plan to analyze how users interact with your app for improving the AI or for research purposes, you might want to store interaction data.

    Customization and Settings: Should the app have configurable settings for different drawing styles or tips customization, a database could store these user-specific settings.

    Feedback System: If the app includes a feedback system where users can submit their thoughts or rate tips, a database would be necessary to collect and analyze this feedback.

    Scaling: If you plan to scale up the app, potentially
